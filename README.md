# Chatbot For Discord Using Discord.js v13
Here is a tutorial for making a chatbot for discord using nodejs/discord.js v13

# Let's get Started
**ðŸ‘‰Method 1**:- In this method, clone this repo and just change the token value  in `.env` According to your bot token! You can remove my credit also :).
<hr/>

**ðŸ‘‰Method 2**:- You can do by your own. Do the following steps
Install packages, for that open terminal/console & Type the following;
```terminal
$npm install discord.js 
$npm install smartestchatbot 
```
After that, you can check out `index.js` file's code and there just edit the owner name and language ! And run the project. 
# How will this work?
Basically you will see in the code that 
```js
  if (message.channel.name == "chatbot")
```
This depicts that if the channel name is chatbot then in that chatbot named Channel the bot will work/ chat.
So at last we can say if you create a channel named chatbot then only the bot will chat in that specific channel
